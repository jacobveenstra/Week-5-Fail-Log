# Week-5-Fail-Log

Started the week with trying to get the Shawville Equity back on my Dhbox as I didnt save it before the 1 month ran out

was easily able to get them back on my dhbox after a lot of waiting for them to download

While waiting for them I googled digital media history projects to try and find some inspiration 

was having trouble getting the years onto nano but Jeff gave me some help with figuring out how to cat the years

was thinking of searchign for the word "war" throughout all the years in the equity but when asked Professor Graham he reccomended that i do just the Korean War

This seems like a much more logical idea and a lot less skimming

The years for this war are 1950-1953

I then started downloading the information from the shawville equity from these years onto my dhbox so that i could extract them onto my computer

Used the code sudo bash -c "cat *1950*>1950all.txt" to save all of the information from each specfic year

replacing the year in the code to the one i want to save

i then proceded to save all of the years onto my computer and put them into their own individual file just named "1950" "1951" and so on

having a tough time trying to figure out which tools I will use and what my exact thesis will be

Looking for a tool that will be able to scan the data for the key words...  example all the articles that mention of Korean War

very much struggling to get the stanford ner application working but i feel as though it could be helpful

It says on the instructions to open it with a command prompt and then to change the file to the one i want but my computer doesnt seem to give me this option

it is only allowing for me to look at the default file

Got the Ner to work and have the file for 1950 in it

Followed all of the steps for getting the Ner to run but it has not been able to show the locations/names/places 

I also need to find a way to make it so it just shows a specific name... Korean War
